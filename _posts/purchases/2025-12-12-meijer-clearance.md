## ⚠️ Important Note - Do Not Purchase From Meijer Again

**DISCLAIMER:** Meijer applies clearance stickers directly onto the Pop boxes, which **significantly damages collectibility**. The stickers leave residue and can tear the box artwork when removed, destroying the mint condition value of the figures.

**Future Action:** Avoid purchasing collectible Funko Pops from Meijer, even at clearance prices, due to their damaging sticker placement practices. The savings are not worth the loss in collectibility and potential resale value.
