This section will be updated as new limited edition figures are acquired. Criteria for limited edition classification:

1. **Limited Print Run** - Confirmed limited production quantity
2. **Exclusive Release** - Store/convention/event exclusives
3. **Chase Variants** - Rare variants with low production ratios
4. **Numbered Editions** - Individually numbered collectibles
5. **Premium Releases** - Higher-end collectibles (10" figures, deluxe sets, etc.)

Standard retail releases purchased at full price do not qualify unless they meet one of the above criteria.
