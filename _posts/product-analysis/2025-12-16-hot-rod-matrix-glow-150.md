## Investment Thesis

**Acquisition Strategy:** Limited print run exclusive purchased at full MSRP during limited availability window.

**Key Value Drivers:**
- Limited print run (scarcity)
- Glow-in-the-dark variant (collectibility feature)
- Popular franchise with strong secondary market
- Character significance (Hot Rod becomes Rodimus Prime)

**Risk Factors:**
- Recent acquisition - no historical resale data yet
- Limited edition market can be volatile
- Glow variants sometimes have mixed long-term appreciation

**Expected Outcome:** Moderate to high appreciation potential over 2-5 year hold period. Strong collector base for Transformers should support steady demand.

## Next Analysis Date

**Recommended:** Q2 2026 (6 months post-acquisition) to assess initial secondary market development.
